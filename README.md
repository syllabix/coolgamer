A collection of games and experiments built with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), a data-driven game engine written in Rust.

## About

This is an exploratory project focused on learning game development with the Bevy engine. The goal is to experiment with different game mechanics, patterns and features while improving Rust programming skills.

## Why Bevy?

My initial expereince with the engine has been positive. I have built some super things but now want to take my knowledge the engine to the next level.

## Games & Experiments

*Coming soon!* This repository will contain various game prototypes and experiments as the learning journey progresses.

## Getting Started

1. Install Rust and Cargo
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `cargo run` to build and run the current game

## Contributing

This is primarily a learning project, but suggestions and feedback are always welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit PRs.
